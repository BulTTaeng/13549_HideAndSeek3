## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , 0-1 bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Typical 0-1 bfs problem.

If the cost is 0 to move , make deque and push_front.

If the cost is 1 to move , push_back.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
